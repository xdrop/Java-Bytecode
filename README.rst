Version

1.0.5

Installation
=============


#. Having installed `Package Control <https://packagecontrol.io/installation>`_ access the ``Command Pallete`` (`Ctrl+Shift+P`), select ``Install package`` and then select ``Java Bytecode``.

#. In the bottom right corner click and select **Java Bytecode > Default** (or `Custom` if you've set up a custom color scheme)


*Alternatively* if you have not installed Package control (which I highly recommend):

#. Go to **Preferences | Browse packages...**
#. While inside the **Packages** directory, clone the theme repository using the command below: 

    ``git clone https://github.com/xdrop/Java-Bytecode.git "Java Bytecode"``




Custom syntax highlighting
===========================
The package comes with support for custom syntax highlighting by including the following custom scopes:

* ``return`` and similar keywords
* ``new`` keyword
* ``getfield/putfield`` and similar field accessors
* ``astore`` and similar local field storing
* ``aload`` and similar local field loaders
* calls to ``invoke...`` 
* ``nop``
* java keywords used by javap
* list of all bytecode instructions

**(!)** To use custom syntax coloring you need to edit the theme you use to provide support for these custom scopes.

Instructions
*************
#. Obtain the ``.tmTheme`` file of the color scheme you are using and wish to edit
#. Open it in a text editor
#. Get the ``addedscopes.xml`` file from this package directory
#. Locate the ``</array>`` closing tag and copy the contents of ``addedscopes.xml`` **before** it.
#. Load your new ``.tmTheme`` file into `tmTheme Editor  <https://github.com/aziz/tmTheme-Editor>`_ and customize it to your needs.
#. Download it and add it to your packages directory.
#. Go to **Preferences | Color Scheme** and select it.
#. Set **Java Bytecode | Custom highlighting** as your language.
